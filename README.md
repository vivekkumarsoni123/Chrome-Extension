I developed a chrome extension using HTML for layouts, CSS for styling (used keyframes for defining my own animation), and javascript for the logic and functions. This extension basically allows you to experience the 
dark mode and light mode on any website in your desired browser. I have written the manifest.json file in version 3 so that it can be executed in the modern browsers. If you still don't believe me then why not try it
atleast once :)
Let's start experiencing something really cool.
